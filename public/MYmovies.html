<h3> Call Me by Your Name </h3>
<p> 
    This film is pure sensuality and emotion. You can see through the character's eyes, taste through their mouths <br>
but most importantly you feel how they feel. Luca Guadagnino manages to extract the very best out of his actors. <br> 
</p>
<h3> Parasite </h3>
<p> 
    The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative<br>
and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.<br>
</p>
<h3>Requiem for a Dream</h3>
<p>
    Great writing, directing and acting performances from all but especially Jennifer Connelly. I have however never<br>
felt that awfully uncomfortable after watching a movie and no matter how fantastic it is, I never want to watch it<br>
again. I do very highly recommend watching it at least once though. <br>
